# Code for topology optimizatio

This is a short version of the code used to make the experiments in the thesis "On numerical experiments in TO".

The Q0 version is a slightly modified version of the 88-line code from the article "Efficient topology optimization in MATLAB using 88 lines of code" of Andreassen et al, modified also from the work of Zhang and Norato in the article "Finding Better Local Optima in Topology Optimization via Tunneling"
The MMA implementation is taken from Svanberg in "The method of moving asymptotesâ€”a new method for structural optimization".
The DQ1 implementation is a heat problem code that implements discontinous functions explained in the MSc thesis, building upon the previous code. 

This code is academic and is free to be modified, but it is not extensively debbugged nor tested in real world applications.
